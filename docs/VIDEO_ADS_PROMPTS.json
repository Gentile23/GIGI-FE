    "veo_3_prompt": "High-octane commercial shot. Opening Hook (0-1s): Extreme close-up of a sweaty, exhausted eye, pupil dilating, grey/bluish lighting, sound of heavy breathing. Suddenly, a neon blue 'shockwave' ripple effect originates from an earbud entering the ear. Cut to (1-3s): Wide explosive shot. The subject transforms from tired to explosive power, sprinting through a dark urban tunnel. A semi-transparent 'Ghost Runner' (glowing blue outlined silhouette representing the AI Coach) runs perfectly synchronized beside him, pacing him. Illuminating the dark tunnel with blue light. Camera movement: Fast lateral tracking shot matching the sprint speed, low angle to make them look heroic. Atmosphere is electric, high contrast, cinematic teal and orange grading. 4k, hyper-realistic.",

An intense RED warning holographic overlay flashes on their lower back, pulsing like a heartbeat (Danger visual). Sound of a digital 'Lock-on'. As the user corrects their hips, the red holographic skeleton snaps instantly into a bright, satisfying NEON GREEN structure with a 'ding' visual ripple effect. Values like 'Spine Load: SAFE' pop up in crisp white text. The room lighting shifts from dim to bright/clean simultaneously to signify 'correctness'. Camera movement: Slight handheld shake during red phase (tension), perfectly stable float during green phase (mastery). Iron Man helmet interface style. 8k resolution.",

IMPACT frame freezes for 0.1s, exploding into golden digital coins and a huge 'CRITICAL HIT' 3D text. Shot 2 (Match Cut): The ball slam transitions seamlessly to a foot landing a jump box. The impact generates a shockwave of XP points floating up (+150 XP). Shot 3: User drinks water, but the water bottle glows like a 'Health Potion' in a RPG. A green health bar above their head fills up to 100%. Final Shot: Phone screen showing a 'Level Up' animation that breaks the fourth wall, with confetti flying OUT of the screen towards the viewer. Lighting: Hyper-saturated, neon rim lights, energetic vibe. Camera: Dynamic zoom-ins on impacts. 4k, Unreal Engine 5 aesthetic.",
